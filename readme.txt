Using simulated annealing algorithm to do fitting. The formula of data is known and I use the data and the algorithm to train the parameter unknown.

sc_SA.m is the main function of SA algorithm. I set the range of unknown parameter in it.
calc_fun.m is the formular.
calc_dis.m is the data and the error function.

The codes can run in Matlab.
